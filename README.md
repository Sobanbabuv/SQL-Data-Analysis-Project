# 📊 Data Analysis on SQL Data Warehouse  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **continuation of my SQL Data Warehouse Project** that was built using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers)**.  

On top of that warehouse, I developed a **Data Analysis layer** to generate insights and business reports. The analysis covers:  

- **Database Exploration** – Understanding schema, relationships, and available data.  
- **Dimension Exploration** – Studying customer, product, and other dimensions.  
- **Date Range Exploration** – Analyzing time-based patterns.  
- **Measure Exploration** – Evaluating key business metrics.  
- **Magnitude Exploration** – Measuring scale and intensity of values.  
- **Ranking Analysis** – Identifying top/bottom performers across categories.  
- **Change Over Time Analysis** – Tracking trends and variations across periods.  
- **Cumulative Analysis** – Understanding progressive growth/decline.  
- **Performance Analysis** – Measuring efficiency and outcomes.  
- **Data Segmentation** – Breaking down data into meaningful groups.  
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis** – Contribution of individual parts to overall metrics.  

At the end of this analysis, structured reports were built for:  
- 📌 **Customer Report**  
- 📌 **Product Report**
